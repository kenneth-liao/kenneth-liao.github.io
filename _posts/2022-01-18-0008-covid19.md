## Objective
Data was obtained from [*Our World in Data*](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data). I created
a dashboard using Plotly and Dash and deployed it to Heroku via Github integration. You can view the live dashboard 
here: https://plotly-dash-covid19.herokuapp.com/

## Updates
2022-01-18: I want to connect a python script to auto update the data from our world in data's github repo.
